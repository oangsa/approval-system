# AI-use declaration

**Project:** Workflow and Approval System (`oangsa/approval-system`)
**Last updated:** 2026-11-06

## Tooling used

- **GitHub Copilot** (agent/assistant mode) was used throughout Sprint 1 work on Issue #1 (Authentication & Role Access) to draft planning documents, implementation code, automated tests, and documentation.
- Conventional editor assistance (completion, refactoring suggestions) was used for routine edits.

## How it was used

- Requirements were read from the repository's frozen specifications (`docs/specs/`), `AGENTS.md`, and issue #1 before any generation.
- Generated changes were reviewed line by line, executed in this workspace, and verified by the project's own commands (typecheck, lint, Vitest unit/API/contract suites, real-PostgreSQL integration suite, Playwright browser suite). Actual results are recorded in [docs/testing-verification.md](docs/testing-verification.md).
- Security-critical behavior (refresh rotation, revocation, authorization guards) was implemented from the reviewed design in `docs/features/identity-access/sds.md` and is covered by real-database tests, not mock-only assertions.

## Boundaries

- No generated content was accepted without execution and test evidence.
- No frozen specification, acceptance criterion, or test identifier was altered to accommodate generated code.
- AI output did not authorize commits, pushes, pull requests, merges, or releases; those actions require explicit human authorization.

## Disclosure for submission

This project was developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot. All submitted code, tests, and documents were reviewed, executed, and verified by the author.
